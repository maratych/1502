        <textblock>
            AC0010 is a novel, potent, small molecule irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that
      selectively targets mutant forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while sparing
      wild-type (WT) EGFR. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
      safety profile of oral AC0010; to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral AC0010; to assess the safety and efficacy of AC0010
      in previously treated mutant EGFR in NSCLC patients with EGFR T790M mutation.

    <detailed_description>
        <textblock>
            Lung cancer remains the most common cancer worldwide with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      accounting for 85% of cases. Molecularly targeted therapies have proven to be superior to
      chemotherapy for NSCLC patients whose tumors have mutations in EGFR. Recent studies have
      established tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as the gold standard for treating
      EGFR-mutation-positive NCSLC. However, patients on TKIs eventually progress, and in
      approximately 50% of cases, progression is due to development of an additional mutation
      called T790M. AC0010 may provide an effective therapy for a patient population with few
      alternative treatment options. Pre-clinical data demonstrated that AC0010 inhibits T790M. It
      is anticipated that AC0010 may promote cell death in tumor cells with the T790M mutation,
      thus providing possible therapeutic benefit in patients who have developed T790M-mediated
      resistance to previous TKIs.

      This is a two-part, open-label study of oral AC0010 administered twice-daily in previously
      treated NSCLC patients who have documented evidence of an activating mutation in the EGFR
      gene and have failed treatment with an EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib, gefitinib or
      afatinib.

      This study will include 2 parts:

      Stage 1 : Dose-escalation Period with 28-day cycles; Optional Treatment Extension Period
      starting on Day 29

      Stage 2 : Evaluation of activity and safety in patients with the EGFR T790M mutation
