        <textblock>
            The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug, TVB-2640, is able to affect
      levels of certain enzymes in subject's blood and cause changes in tumor. This study is only
      for people who require surgery for their colon cancer.

            The Purpose of study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects on metabolic endpoints (malonyl
      carnitine and tripalmitin levels) following short-term treatment with TVB-2640 in patients
      with resectable colon cancer.48 evaluable patients will be enrolled in the study. The accrual
      rate is estimated to be 4 per month.

            TVB-2640 is a potent and reversible inhibitor of the FASN enzyme. TVB-2640 inhibits the β-ketoacyl reductase (KR) enzymatic activity of the FASN enzyme. TVB-2640 is uncompetitive towards both NADPH and acetoacetyl-CoA in inhibiting KR activity.

                Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed, resectable colon cancer without distant
             metastases, who are candidates for surgical resection of the tumor.

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent prior to initiation of any study
             procedures.

          -  Male or female who is ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 (fully active, able
             to carry out all pre-disease activities without restriction) or 1 (unable to perform
             physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out work of a light or
             sedentary nature).

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by:

               1. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

               2. ANC count ≥ 1.5 X 109/L

               3. Platelets ≥ 100 X 109/L

          -  No significant ischemic heart disease or myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months
             before the first dose of study drug and currently has adequate cardiac function, as
             evidenced by a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥ 50% as assessed by
             multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) or ultrasound/echocardiography (ECHO); and corrected QT
             interval (QTc) &lt; 470 msec

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If
             the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test
             will be required.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control, be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 90 days after the last dose of study medication. Subjects of
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

          -  Male patients should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with
             the first dose of study therapy through 90 days after the last dose of study therapy,
             or documented to be surgically sterile

          -  Willing to participate in the study and comply with all study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to swallow oral medications or impairment of GI function or GI disease that
             may significantly alter drug absorption (including, but not limited to active
             inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption syndrome). Concomitant therapy with antacids
             and anti-emetics is permissible

          -  History of risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g., heart failure, hypokalemia,
             family history of long QT syndrome). Concomitant use of medications with a low risk of
             QT/QTc prolongation (including, but not limited to diphenhydramine, famotidine,
             ondansetron) is permissible.

          -  Known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with cooperation
             with the requirements of the trial.

          -  Having received cancer-directed therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy,
             biologic or immunotherapy, etc) or an investigational drug within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             mitomycin C and nitrosoureas) or 5 half-lives of that agent (whichever is shorter)
             before the first dose of study drug.

          -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the prescreening or screening visit
             through 90 days after the last dose of trial treatment

          -  Inoperable on the basis of co-existent medical problems

          -  History of clinically significant dry eye (xerophthalmia) or other corneal abnormality
             or, if a contact lens wearer, does not agree to abstain from contact lens use from Day
             1 through the last dose of study drug.

          -  Other concurrent disease (cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, etc.) or laboratory
             abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion would increase the risk of
             participating in the study.
