                    The actin and microtubule cytoskeletons are critically important for cancer cell proliferation, and drugs that target microtubules are widely-used cancer therapies. However, their utility is compromised by toxicities due to dose and exposure. To overcome these issues, we characterized how inhibition of the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton regulatory LIM kinases could be used in drug combinations to increase efficacy. A previously-described LIMK inhibitor (LIMKi) induced dose-dependent microtubule alterations that resulted in significant mitotic defects, and increased the cytotoxic potency of microtubule polymerization inhibitors. By combining LIMKi with 366 compounds from the GSK Published Kinase Inhibitor Set, effective combinations were identified with kinase inhibitors including EGFR, p38 and Raf. These findings encouraged a drug discovery effort that led to development of CRT0105446 and CRT0105950, which potently block LIMK1 and LIMK2 activity in vitro, and inhibit cofilin phosphorylation and increase αTubulin acetylation in cells. CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 were screened against 656 cancer cell lines, and rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and kidney cancer cells were identified as significantly sensitive to both LIMK inhibitors. These large-scale screens have identified effective LIMK inhibitor drug combinations and sensitive cancer types. In addition, the LIMK inhibitory compounds CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 will enable further development of LIMK-targeted cancer therapy.

                    The LIM kinases 1 and 2 (LIMK1 and LIMK2) are central regulators of cytoskeletal dynamics [1, 2]. Although their regulation of cofilin activity and filamentous actin (F-actin) stability have been extensively studied [3], they also contribute to microtubule dynamics via less well characterized mechanisms [4–6]. Given their cytoskeleton-associated functions and indications of elevated expression in various cancer types, research has largely focussed on their roles in tumor cell migration, invasion and metastasis [7–9]. More recent studies have shown that the LIM kinases modulate additional activities that contribute to cancer development, including cell proliferation and survival [4–6]. LIMK activity also contributes to cancer cell resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents and ionizing radiation, while blocking LIMK activity reverses this resistance or even increases sensitivity [10–14]. These observations have spurred efforts directed towards the discovery of LIMK inhibitors as potential cancer therapeutic agents that could be used as single agents or as part of combination therapies [15–17].
                </P>
                <P>
                    In recent years, the focus of cancer drug discovery has evolved from developing chemotherapeutics that could be widely-used across multiple cancers to treatments tailored for specific tumor types. In particular, this has led to the development of targeted therapies that utilise unique molecular properties identified in malignant cells to preferentially target tumor cells, while reducing potential detrimental effects on normal cells [18]. However, molecularly-targeted therapies have not been as successful as originally anticipated, with high rates of failure and limited numbers of patients that manifest positive clinical responses.
                </P>
                <P>
                    In order to improve chances for targeted therapy success, two strategies have been considered. Firstly, as an alternative or complement to molecularly-targeted therapies, other proteins or biological processes may be important targets because of accessory or auxiliary functions they provide. For example, stresses induced by oncogenic transformation often lead to reliance upon heat-shock protein chaperones, such that inhibition of heat shock proteins including Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hsp27 has become a large area of cancer drug development [19]. Similarly, associations between human cancers and alterations in the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons have been well documented [20], suggesting that drugs targeting cytoskeleton regulators might be efficacious for the treatment of certain tumor types [15–17]. Unbiased screening may reveal drug sensitivities that reflect dependence on these auxiliary functions that would not be identified by genetic profiling.
                </P>
                <P>
                    A number of small molecule LIMK inhibitors have been discovered [6, 21–25] and several have been reported to be efficacious as single agent therapeutics on cancer cells including: breast [6, 26], pancreatic [27], prostate [5], cervical adenocarcinoma [6], fibromatosis [28], leukemia [4, 6] and glioma [29]. To identify how LIMK inhibitors might best be utilized, we carried out two cell-based screens. In the first, a LIMK inhibitor was combined with microtubule-targeting drugs, or the GSK published kinase inhibitor set (PKIS) of 366 small molecule kinase inhibitors [30], to identify combinations with positive interactions. In the second, two novel LIMK inhibitors we developed were used to screen 656 tumor cell lines to identify cancer types with significant sensitivity to their anti-proliferative effects. These large-scale and unbiased cell-based screens revealed a range of drug combinations that could be considered for further development, and identified tumor types with significant sensitivity to LIMK inhibition.

                <P>
                    To determine how LIMK inhibition affects cancer cell proliferation, we made use of the small molecular inhibitor N-{5-[2-(2,6-Dichloro-phenyl)-5-difluoromethyl-2H-pyrazol-3-yl]-thiazol-2-yl}-isobutyramide (compound 3 in [21]; hereafter referred to as LIMKi) that blocks both LIMK1 (7 nM IC50 in vitro) and LIMK2 (8 nM IC50) activity. The results of selectivity profiling of LIMKi at 10 μM against 287 kinases [21] using KINOMEscan technology [31] was mapped onto a kinome phylogenetic tree [32] in Supplemental Figure 1A. To compare specificity quantitatively, the LIMKi S(35) selectivity score (a ratio of kinases inhibited by &gt; 65% relative to the total number of kinases) was compared to S(35) values for 38 additional kinase inhibitors, including 7 FDA licenced drugs, at 10 μM (Supplemental Figure 1B; LIMKi indicated in blue). Furthermore, the inset graph in Supplemental Figure 1B of LIMKi S(1) (i.e. proportion of kinases inhibited by 99%), S(10) (proportion of kinases inhibited by 90%) and S(35) selectivity scores indicates the high selectivity of LIMKi. At 10 μM LIMKi, only 13 kinase targets (ADCK3, ALK4, AMPKα1, AMPKα2, BRSK1, BRSK2, DCAMKL1, DCAMKL2, DDR1, FGFR1, PAK3, PCTAIRE1) in addition to LIMK1 and LIMK2 were inhibited by &gt; 65% [21]. We validated the dose-dependent effect of LIMKi on inhibiting LIMK activity by treating A549 human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells for 18 hours with DMSO vehicle or 1, 3 or 10 μM LIMKi [9, 21] and western blotting for phosphorylation of cofilin, a well-characterized LIMK substrate [9] (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A). We next examined how microtubule organization was affected by LIMKi in non-dividing cells by treating A549 cells for 24 hours with DMSO vehicle or 3 or 10 μM LIMKi. Representative images show progressive changes in microtubule morphology with increasing LIMKi dose (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B). To determine whether this effect was associated with changes in microtubule stability, we analysed the effect of LIMKi on αTubulin acetylation [33]. Confocal images of A549 cells co-stained with antibodies against acetylated-αTubulin (Figure ​(Figure1C;1C; green) and total αTubulin (Figure ​(Figure1C;1C; red) revealed a concentration-dependent increase in αTubulin acetylation after 24-hour LIMKi treatment. Quantification of fluorescence intensities revealed a moderate increase in αTubulin acetylation in response to 3 μM LIMKi, and a significant increase in response to 10 μM LIMKi treatment, relative to DMSO vehicle control. These results indicate that the LIMK inhibitor affected microtubule organization and post-translational modification.
                </P>
                <P>
                    To investigate the role of LIMK in mitosis, we analyzed the effect of LIMKi on mitotic spindle morphology. A549 cells were treated for 24 hours with DMSO vehicle, 3 or 10 μM LIMKi, then fixed and stained with αTubulin antibody and the DNA stain 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). We observed significant alterations in spindle microtubule structure and organization with increasing LIMKi concentrations, including; decreased or complete loss of aster microtubules, defects in spindle microtubule integrity, defects in microtubule polymerization, or the appearance of monoastral spindles (Figure ​(Figure2).2). To quantify these effects, &gt; 10 representative mitotic cells per treatment were morphologically characterised for the above abnormalities and the percentage occurrence of each microtubule defect in three independent replicate experiments was determined (Figure ​(Figure2).2). The occurrence of microtubule defects during mitosis progressively increased with increasing LIMKi concentration, with significant decreases in the percentage of normal cells with increasing LIMKi concentration (Figure ​(Figure2).2). Therefore, we concluded that treatment with a LIMK inhibitory compound had a strong effect on cancer cell mitosis.

                    Consistent with the sensitivity of A549 cells to LIMKi, active phosphorylated LIM kinases have been previously found to co-localise with γTubulin at mitotic cell centrosomes [34]. To test if LIMK activity was important for active LIMK localization and mitotic spindle assembly, we tested the effect of LIMKi on active phosphorylated LIMK (p-LIMK) and γTubulin co-localization in mitotic A549 cells (Figure ​(Figure3A).3A). Treatment with 3 μM LIMKi had no effect on p-LIMK localization, indicating that p-LIMK localization to centrosomes is independent from LIMK activity (Figure ​(Figure3B).3B). Consistent with previous results [12], 3 μM LIMKi eliminated basal and induced cofilin phosphorylation, indicating inhibition of LIMK activity, while only slightly reducing LIMK phosphorylation (Figure ​(Figure3C).3C). Treatment with a low concentration of the vinca alkaloid Vincristine (5 nM), which did not detectably affect spindle morphology [35] had a small effect on p-LIMK and γTubulin co-localization (Figure ​(Figure3B).3B). The combination of 5 nM Vincristine and 3 μM LIMKi had a significant effect on p-LIMK and γTubulin co-localization greater than DMSO vehicle or Vincristine alone (Figure ​(Figure3B).3B). Moreover, immunofluorescence images show that combined LIMKi and vincristine treatment also had the strongest effect on spindle integrity, indicating possible co-operation between microtubules and LIMK function in mitosis (Figure ​(Figure3A3A).

                </P>
                <P>
                    The effect of LIMKi combined with Vincristine on mitotic spindle integrity led us to test if LIMKi would have a combination effect on cancer cell proliferation. While 3 μM LIMKi alone did not affect A549 cell numbers, when treated with a concentration range of Vincristine in the presence of 3 μM LIMKi or DMSO in a 3-day assay based on counting remaining cell number, there was a ~2 fold decrease in Vincristine EC50 in the presence of LIMKi, indicating a synergistic cooperation between Vincristine and LIMKi (Figure ​(Figure4A).4A). By comparing the effects of fixed ratios of Vincristine (0.625-5 nM) and LIMKi (2.5-20 μM) concentrations on cell viability as determined by CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay, an average Combination Index of 0.77 + 0.02 indicating synergy was determined by the Chou-Talalay method [36] for LIMKi concentrations &lt; 10 μM (Figure ​(Figure4B).4B). Furthermore, there was ~2-fold difference in Vincristine EC50 between spontaneously immortalized wild-type (WT) and Limk2−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts as determined by counting remaining cells (Figure ​(Figure4C).4C). To determine how the combined treatment of LIMKi and Vincristine decreased cell numbers, we profiled DNA content by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) of propidium iodide (PI) stained cells. The proportions of cells with 4N DNA content, indicative of G2/M cell cycle phases, were progressively increased with Vincristine concentration when combined with 3 μM LIMKi (Figure ​(Figure4D,4D, left panel) or with increased LIMKi concentration when combined with 5 nM Vincristine (Figure ​(Figure4D,4D, right panel) relative to DMSO vehicle control. In addition, the proportion of &lt; 2N DNA content, typically a reflection of DNA fragmentation during apoptosis, progressively increased with increased Vincristine concentration when combined with 3 μM LIMKi (Figure ​(Figure4E,4E, left panel) or with increased LIMKi concentration when combined with 5 nM Vincristine (Figure ​(Figure4E,4E, right panel) relative to DMSO vehicle control. Taken together, these results indicate that the combined effect of LIMKi and a microtubule polymerization inhibitor was at least partially due to impaired mitosis, leading to impaired G2/M cell cycle progression and subsequent apoptosis.
                </P>
                <P>
                    To determine whether this effect was specific for Vincristine, we tested additional microtubule-targeting drugs with and without LIMKi. The microtubule polymerization inhibitors Vinorelbine (Figure ​(Figure4F)4F) and Colchicine (Figure ​(Figure4G)4G) had similar ~2-fold decreases in EC50 in the presence of LIMKi. These results indicate that LIMKi synergizes with agents that target microtubule polymerization.

                <P>
                    Given the consistent positive interactions between LIMKi and microtubule polymerization inhibitors, we wished to determine whether other cancer drug targets would also combine with LIMK inhibition to block cancer cell proliferation. A high-throughput screen was undertaken using the GSK published kinase inhibitor set (PKIS) of 366 small molecule kinase inhibitors [30]. A549 cells were treated with half-log serial dilutions of library compounds in the presence of 3 μM LIMKi or DMSO. Compounds having either no cytotoxic effect (Figure ​(Figure5A),5A), or an effect that did not reach 50% alone (Figure ​(Figure5B),5B), but achieved more than 50% reduction in relative cell number when combined with 3 μM LIMKi were selected as 20 hits (Supplemental Table 1). Compounds that produced a greater than 2-fold decrease in absolute EC50 when combined with 3 μM LIMKi (Figure ​(Figure5C)5C) were selected as 43 additional hits (Figure ​(Figure5D;5D; Supplemental Table 2). Remaining compounds either did not fit these criteria selection criteria (Supplemental Table 3) or were without combination effects (Supplemental Table 4).
                </P>
                <P>
                    To identify common drug targets from the selected hits, kinase inhibitor selectivity data for the 63 hits from GSK were clustered by pairwise average-linkage cluster analysis with the dot product distance option using TM4 [37] (Figure ​(Figure5E),5E), with color gradations ranging from 0% (black) to 100% inhibition (yellow). Amongst the most frequently occurring designated targets were VEGFR or VEGFR/TIE2, GSK3, AKT, CDK2 and IGF1R. However, the broad specificity of these inhibitors makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the contributions of individual kinases to the observed combination effects. In contrast, there were some clusters of kinase inhibitors with narrow selectivity profiles that highlight certain kinase targets as possibly indicating biological interactions with LIMK signaling, including PLK1, RAF, EGFR/ErbB2 and p38. These results indicate that there may be mechanism-based effective drug combinations with LIMK inhibitors, in addition to microtubule polymerization inhibitors, that could be characterized further for potential clinical use.

                    Given the potential for the use of LIMK inhibitors as cancer chemotherapeutics, a high-throughput drug discovery and medicinal chemistry program was undertaken. Details of the screening methodology and description of initial hit matter were described in [38]. Following iterative rounds of lead optimization medicinal chemistry and in vitro enzyme assays, two compounds were developed with potent LIMK inhibitory activity; N-{5-[3-(4-Methoxy-2-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyridin-4-yl]-hiazol-2-yl}-isobutyramide (CRT0105446; Figure ​Figure6A)6A) and 4-{5-[3-(2-Chloro-4-methyl-phenyl)-pyridin-4-yl]-thiazol-2-ylamino}-phenol (CRT0105950; Figure ​Figure6B).6B). Details of their chemical synthesis are described in Charles et al. [39]. The in vitro IC50 values for LIMK1 and LIMK2 were 8 nM and 32 nM respectively for CRT0105446, and 0.3 nM and 1 nM respectively for CRT0105950. These and additional physiochemical parameters are in Supplemental Table 5. Kinase selectivity was profiled for 442 kinases using KINOMEscan technology [31] at 10 μM CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 (Supplemental Table 6), and mapped onto a kinome phylogenetic tree [32] in Figure ​Figure6A6A and ​and6B.6B. To compare specificity quantitatively, CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 S(35) selectivity scores (Figure ​(Figure6C;6C; indicated in blue), a ratio of kinases inhibited by &gt;65% relative to the total number of kinases, were compared to S(35) values for 38 additional kinase inhibitors, including 7 FDA licenced drugs, at 10 μM (Figure ​(Figure6C).6C). Furthermore, the inset graph in Figure ​Figure6C6C depicting S(1) (i.e. proportion of kinases inhibited by 99%), S(10) (proportion of kinases inhibited by 90%) and S(35) selectivity scores depicts the greater selectivity of CRT0105446 relative to the more potent CRT0105950.

                    We compared the cell-based potencies of CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 with LIMKi using three read-outs: cofilin phosphorylation, αTubulin acetylation and three-dimensional (3-D) extracellular matrix invasion. All three compounds were equivalently potent at increasing αTubulin acetylation (Figure ​(Figure7A)7A) and decreasing cofilin phosphorylation (Figure ​(Figure7B)7B) in A549 lung cancer cells. To more precisely determine cell-based LIMK inhibitor activity, MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated with 2 μg/mL doxorubicin, which strongly increases cofilin phosphorylation through increased p53-mediated transcription of LIMK2 and RhoC genes [12] to increase the dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio of the assay, and varying concentrations of LIMK inhibitors for 18 hr, then cells were fixed and stained for immunofluorescence determination of phosphorylated cofilin intensity. Dose-response analysis revealed that all three compounds inhibited cofilin phosphorylation, with LIMKi being ~2-fold more potent than CRT0105950 and 7-fold more potent than CRT0105446 in this assay format (Figure ​(Figure7C).7C). We additionally established that LIMK inhibition resulted in decreased cofilin phosphorylation in MDAMB231 human breast cancer cells by comparing the effect of a range of LIMKi and CRT0105950 concentrations on phospho-cofilin levels. As shown in Figure ​Figure7D7D and ​and7E,7E, both inhibitors induced dose-dependent decreases in cofilin phosphorylation. Finally, the inverse invasion of 3-D matrigel by MDAMB231 breast cancer cells above a 60 μm cut-off was significantly inhibited by 3 μM LIMKi, CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 (Figure ​(Figure7F),7F), consistent with our previous observations using LIMKi [9]. These results are consistent with all three inhibitors being potent inhibitors of LIMK activity in cells.

                    To identify cancer cell types with significant sensitivity to chemical LIMK inhibitors, a screen was performed on 656 cancer cell lines [40] with CRT0105950 and CRT0105446. Each inhibitor was tested at concentrations from 0.3-10 μM, and cell numbers determined as described in [40]. By comparing calculated EC50 values for cell lines (Supplemental Tables 7-8) within a given cancer type against all cancer cell lines (Supplemental Table 9-10), significantly (p &lt; 0.05) sensitive and resistant cancer types were identified. Figure ​Figure8A8A shows natural log EC50 values (in μM) of CRT0105950 for each cell line within each cancer type, with a red line indicating mean EC50 and arranged in order of their mean EC50 from low to high values. Relative to the mean EC50 of CRT0105950 for all cancer cell lines (19.2 μM), there were 5 cancer types that were significantly sensitive and 5 cancer types that were significantly resistant (shown with green dots). Similarly, 3 cancer types were significantly sensitive and 5 were significantly resistant (Figure ​(Figure8B,8B, orange dots), relative to the mean EC50 of all cancer cells to CRT0105446 (238 μM).

                <P>
                    To determine which cancer types were most likely affected by the on-target effects of CRT0105446 and CRT0105950, we plotted the mean EC50 values for both drugs of each cancer type (Figure ​(Figure9).9). Cancer types that were significantly sensitive or resistant to both drugs are indicated with red dots, while those cancer types significantly affected by CRT0105446 are depicted with orange dots and those significantly affected by CRT0105950 are shown with green dots. Deming regression indicates that the slope of a fitted line was significantly different from 0, indicating that there was a direct relationship between cancer type responses to both drugs. This analysis revealed that neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and kidney cancer cells were significantly sensitive to both LIMK inhibitors, with 6 additional cancer types being sensitive to either inhibitor and trending towards sensitivity to the other (e.g. Ewing's sarcoma, osteosarcoma and additional soft tissue cancer cell lines). Burkitt lymphoma and B cell lymphoma were the only significantly resistant cancer types, with 4 additional cancer types being sensitive to either inhibitor and trending towards sensitivity towards the other (e.g. Hodgkin lymphoma and myeloma).

                <P>
                    To validate the sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to LIMK inhibitors, we tested 6 neuroblastoma cell lines for their responses to LIMKi (Figure 10A). When the mean natural log EC50 values of LIMKi for these 6 cell lines were compared to CRT0105950 and CRT0105446 EC50 values for the 27 neuroblastoma cell lines from the screen, both LIMKi and CRT0105950 were significantly more effective than CRT0105446 but were not different from each other (Figure 10B), consistent with their rank order of potencies for inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation, tubulin acetylation and matrix invasion (Figure ​(Figure7).7). To corroborate the requirement for LIMK activity in neuroblastoma cells, we knocked down LIMK1 and LIMK2, either by combining two siRNA oligonucleotides (LIMK1+LIMK2) or using an siRNA oligonucleotide (panLIMK) that reduces expression of both proteins, in SK-N-AS and SK-N-SH cells (Figure 10C). Relative to a non-targeting control (NTC) oligonucleotide, both forms of LIMK knockdown significantly reduced neuroblastoma cell viability in SK-N-AS cells (Figure 10D) and SK-N-SH cells (Figure 10E).

                <P>DISCUSSION</P>
                <P>
                    The LIM kinases have well characterized roles in regulating the actin cytoskeleton through their regulation of cofilin activity, and consequently have been regarded as potential targets for anti-metastasis therapy [1, 15, 41]. It has recently emerged that LIMK1 and LIMK2 also influence microtubule dynamics and have important functions in mitosis [4, 5, 13], which is consistent with LIMK inhibitors being potential cancer therapeutics. In the present study, the effect of inhibiting LIMK activity on microtubule structures and mitosis has been validated, and combinations with microtubule destabilizing drugs shown to act synergistically. By screening the PKIS compound library, additional potential drug combinations with LIMK inhibition were identified, including EGFR and Raf kinases. Previous research on the chemosensitivity of 39 human cancer cell lines to 55 anti-cancer drugs revealed that elevated LIMK2 expression was significantly correlated to resistance to 18 drugs (including topoisomerase I inhibitors, bleomycin derivatives and anthracyclines such as doxorubicin) independent of the tissue of origin [10]. We also showed that DNA damaging agents induce LIMK2 expression via p53, while inhibition or knockdown of LIMK2 activity increased sensitivity to these chemotherapeutics [12]. Taken together, these findings are consistent with LIMK activity being an important contributory factor to drug resistance.

                <P>
                    To identify cancer types sensitive to LIMK inhibition, 656 cancer cell lines were screened with dose ranges of CRT0105446 and CRT0105950 that enabled statistical comparison of drug sensitivity. Three cancer types were significantly sensitive to both LIMK inhibitors; rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma and kidney cancer. Interestingly, previous research showed that neuroblastoma cells selected for resistance to Vincristine had increased LIMK2 expression, while LIMK2 knockdown led to the formation of abnormal mitotic spindles and sensitized neuroblastoma cells to Vincristine and Vinblastine [13]. Furthermore, LIMK2 knockdown increased cell cycle arrest apoptosis induced by microtubule targeting drugs [11]. These results are consistent with a prominent role for LIMK signalling in neuroblastoma.

                    The two novel LIMK inhibitors described in the present study, CRT0105446 and CRT0105950, are potent inhibitors of LIMK1 and LIMK2 that will enable further development of LIMK-targeted cancer therapy.
